  * New upstream release.

  [Fathi Boudra]
  * Switch to quilt patch system.
  * Update copyright. Add Trolltech GPL Exception.
  * Update section in Debian menu files.
  * Update patches for Qt4.3.1.
  * Remove 51_kfreebsd_mkspecs patch. Moved in rules.
  * Add 0187-fix-font-fixed-pitch patch:
    This patch works around broken QFontInfo::fixedPitch by always using a
    glyph metrics comparison test to guess the information. This has the
    property of both ignoring (bad) and not relying on (good) any information
    that might be provided by the OS's font facility. For Mac OS X only.
  * Remove patches merged upstream:

    * 0183-qprocess-corruption

qt4-x11 (4.3.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [Fathi Boudra]
  * Update 01_qmake_for_debian patch. Add DEFINES += QT_SHARED in qmake.conf
    along with the removal of link_prl. (Closes: #434019)
  * Apply qt-copy patches:
    * 00_0185-fix-format-strings: This patch fixes various code issues with
      handling format strings. None of them seem to be exceptionally bad,
      but its better safe than sorry. It is related to CVE-2007-3388.
      TT claims the problem is not present in any version of Qt 4. Dirk Muller
      disagrees and believes that some of them are possible to exploit.
    * 00_0186-fix-component-alpha-text: This patch fixes component alpha
      (LCD hinted) text when it's drawn on a non-opaque background. Qt doesn't
      initialize the alpha channel in the glyph masks, which causes problems
      in Konsole when transparency is enabled, and in other situations where
      the background isn't fully opaque.

    * 06_qtdemo_destdir: remove QT_BUILD_TREE in qtdemo DESTDIR target.
      (Closes: #408639)
  * Revert Qt handling argb visuals on X11 patch. There are dependencies

  * Update Qt support for new window types used for compositing patch.
    Fix crashes when 'w' is null. (Closes: #431322)

      the emulated information coming from xrandr 1.2.
    * 00_0177-qurl-clear-fix: fix QUrl::clear(). Applied upstream.
    * 00_0183-qprocess-corruption: fix plain data loss bug. Applied Upstream.

  [Brian Nelson]
  * Changed dist back to unstable.
  * Tightened qt4-dev-tools's dependency on libqt4-core to

    Qt whose ABI can change. (Closes: #429817)
  * Added a build-dependency on libxi-dev to enable tablet support.
  * Constrict the hack to clean all binary files to the bin, config.tests,
    and qmake directories to drastically improve its speed

    * 00_0176-coverity-fixes: Fix various obvious memory leaks.

    dangling if libqt4-debug isn't installed and prevents failed linking
    due to version mismatches.  (Closes: #346603, #346605)

  * Re-enabled sqlite3 support.  It's still statically linked, however,
    but that'll have to do because I really don't want to futz with the
    build system. (Closes: #330976)

  * Enabled sqlite2 support

  * debian/patches/15_alpha_ftbfs_fix.dpatch: new patch to rename
    q_atomic_test_and_set_release_ptr to q_atomic_test_and_set_ptr, as
    suggested by Isaac Clerencia <isaac@debian.org>, to fix a FTBFS on
    alpha. (Closes: #347353)

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_for_debian: renamed from
    10_qmake_use_qt4_tools, and updated to remove the "link_prl" from the
    default qmake CONFIG line.  This disables the recursive linkage
    against all indirectly-used libraries. (Closes: #343190)

qt4-x11 (4.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixes missing QBitArray operators (Closes: #341658)
    - Fixes qmake problem with including bad build path (Closes: #327359)
  
  * Added the new QTestLib unit testing framework to the libqt4-core
    package

  * Added the new QtSvg module to the libqt4-gui package

  * debian/patches/13_arm_gcc4.dpatch: new patch from Jeremy Laine to fix
    FTBFS on arm (Closes: #343176)

  * debian/patches/14_kfreebsd_build_fix.dpatch: new patch from Petr
    Salinger to fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD (Closes: #343191)

  * Split the qtconfig tool out of libqt4-gui and into a separate
    qt4-qtconfig package, due to its linkage against libqt4-qt3support and
    hence ridiculous dependency chain.

  * debian/rules: improved/cleaned up the clean target

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Wed,  4 Jan 2006 12:56:23 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a target to automatically install lintian overrides, stolen from
    debian-qt-kde.mk

  * Added a bunch of lintian overrides for stuff that should be ignored

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Nov 2005 01:17:03 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: made libqt4-gui replace libqt4-core (<< 4.0.1-3), for
    the plugins move (Closes: #336492)

  * debian/control: removed the mention of a qt4-examples package that
    doesn't actually exist from the qt4-doc package description

  * debian/rules: remove all *.so files under
    examples/tools/plugandpaint/plugins/ in the clean target
    (Closes: #339674)

  * Removed the menu entry for designer-qt4 from qt4-dev-tools.menu, and
    added it to a new qt4-designer.menu

  * Added a tarball of the examples to qt4-doc (Closes: #336832)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Nov 2005 10:27:03 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed qt4-designer's section to "devel"

  * Added a patch from Thiemo Seufer to fix the FTBFS on mips/mipsel
    (Closes: #335831)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Oct 2005 00:13:40 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: only install the non-debug codecs, since
    the debug ones pull in a gratuitous dependency on libqt4-debug
    (Closes: #328913)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: install the debug codecs here instead

  * debian/control: replaced obsolete xlibs-dev dependency with the
    required split packages (Closes: #329302)

  * Completely disabled SQLite support since it's too fubar in this
    version to be usable.  The build fails with SQLite2 support, and
    SQLite3 is only supported by linking staticly with a version
    distributed in the Qt source.  Meh.

  * Renamed libqt4-designer to qt4-designer, merged in the designer binary
    from qt4-dev-tools, and added a dependency on libqt4-dev
    (Closes: #330094)

  * Moved the plugins installed in libqt4-core to libqt4-gui, since they
    link against the GUI library.  Otherwise a circular libqt4-core <->
    libqt4-gui dependency results.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Oct 2005 00:28:53 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_use_qt4_tools.dpatch: new patch that modifies
    qmake.conf so that qmake generates Makefiles that use the -qt4 tools.
    This way, it can cope with systems that have alternatives set to use
    the -qt3 versions.
  
  * Increased the conflicting Qt3 package versions to <= 3.3.4-7, since
    the Qt3 packages still don't use the alternatives system as needed to
    coexist with Qt4.
  
  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added /usr/lib/qt4/plugins/codecs

  * debian/patches/11_launch_assistant-qt4: new patch that modifies the
    QAssistantClient class to launch Qt Assistant as "assistant-qt4" to
    cope with the alternatives system (Closes: #327294)

  * debian/control: Upgraded libqt4-dev's dependencies on the modules
    libqt4-sql and libqt4-qt3support from suggests to depends, and added
    libpq-dev and libmysqlclient14-dev | libmysqlclient-dev as
    dependencies.  These dependencies are apparently required to make
    building pkg-config-using packages happy. (Closes: #327618)

  * debian/control: corrected libqt4-sql to suggest libmysqlclient14-dev,
    not libmysqlclient12-dev which is deprecated

  * debian/copyright: updated FSF snailmail address

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: removed the libqt3supportwidgets_debug.so
    designer plugin, since for some reason having this installed breaks
    designer (Closes: #325782)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Sep 2005 12:32:53 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Install changes-4.0.1 as upstream changelog
  
  * debian/manpages/assistant-qt4.1: new manpage written from scratch
    based on the output of "assistant -help"

  * debian/manpages/designer-qt4.1, debian/manpages/linguist-qt4.1:
    manpages stolen from the Qt3 packages and trivially adapted for Qt4
    (Closes: #322403)

  * debian/manpages/moc-qt4.1: escape some '-' characters

  * debian/qt4-dev-tools.manpages: install the new assistant-qt4.1,
    designer-qt4.1, and linguist-qt4.1 manpages

  * debian/control: made qt4-dev-tools recommend qt4-doc, since assisant
    needs it to be useful (Closes: #323251)

  * Removed the FAQ from qt4-doc.docs, since it's no longer included in
    4.0.1, and was useless anyway

  * Build-depend on libmysqlclient14-dev since libmysqlclient12-dev is
    scheduled to be removed

  * debian/libqt4-dev.install: work around TT's broken "install" target in
    this release so that the pkgconfig files are installed in
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig instead of directly in /usr/lib.  Grrrr.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Aug 2005 19:28:35 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed the xlibs-pic dependency to xlibs-static-pic
    for the X.org transition (Closes: #319586)

  * Added manpages for lrelease, lupdate, moc, qtconfig, and uic, stolen
    from the Qt3 upstream tarball, and wrote a manpage for qmake from
    scratch.  Since now manpages are included for all executables using
    the alternatives, the symlinks to them no longer dangle.
    (Closes: #319456)

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added
    usr/lib/qt4/plugins/imageformats/libqjpeg.so to include the jpeg
    plugin (Closes: #321582)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: added the libqjpeg_debug.so plugin
  
  * debian/rules: don't hardcode the /usr/include/postgresql/8.0 path,
    instead of the output of `pg_config --includedir`, stolen from Qt3
    packages

  * debian/libqt4-gui.install: added the OpenGL module library so that it
    actually gets included in a package (Closes: #321874)

  * debian/control: updated the package descriptions to note that the
    Network and XML modules are included in the libqt4-core package, and
    the OpenGL module is included in the libqt4-gui package

qt4-x11 (4.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * libqt4-dev: added /usr/bin/uic3 (Closes: #318451)

  * Transition to the new X.org packages:
    + (Build-)depend on libglu1-xorg-dev instead of xlibmesa-gl-dev
    + (Build-)depend on libxinerama-dev (Closes: #318682)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jul 2005 21:28:19 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
