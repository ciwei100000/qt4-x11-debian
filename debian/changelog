qt4-x11 (4.0.1-5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * debian/control: made libqt4-gui replace libqt4-core (<< 4.0.1-3), for
    the plugins move (Closes: #336492)

  * debian/control: removed the mention of a qt4-examples package that
    doesn't actually exist from the qt4-doc package description

  * debian/rules: remove all *.so files under
    examples/tools/plugandpaint/plugins/ in the clean target
    (Closes: #339674)

  * Removed the menu entry for designer-qt4 from qt4-dev-tools.menu, and
    added it to a new qt4-designer.menu

  * Added a tarball of the examples to qt4-doc (Closes: #336832)

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed qt4-designer's section to "devel"

  * Added a patch from Thiemo Seufer to fix the FTBFS on mips/mipsel
    (Closes: #335831)

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: only install the non-debug codecs, since
    the debug ones pull in a gratuitous dependency on libqt4-debug
    (Closes: #328913)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: install the debug codecs here instead

  * debian/control: replaced obsolete xlibs-dev dependency with the
    required split packages (Closes: #329302)

  * Completely disabled SQLite support since it's too fubar in this
    version to be usable.  The build fails with SQLite2 support, and
    SQLite3 is only supported by linking staticly with a version
    distributed in the Qt source.  Meh.

  * Renamed libqt4-designer to qt4-designer, merged in the designer binary
    from qt4-dev-tools, and added a dependency on libqt4-dev
    (Closes: #330094)

  * Moved the plugins installed in libqt4-core to libqt4-gui, since they
    link against the GUI library.  Otherwise a circular libqt4-core <->
    libqt4-gui dependency results.

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_use_qt4_tools.dpatch: new patch that modifies
    qmake.conf so that qmake generates Makefiles that use the -qt4 tools.
    This way, it can cope with systems that have alternatives set to use
    the -qt3 versions.
  
  * Increased the conflicting Qt3 package versions to <= 3.3.4-7, since
    the Qt3 packages still don't use the alternatives system as needed to
    coexist with Qt4.
  
  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added /usr/lib/qt4/plugins/codecs

  * debian/patches/11_launch_assistant-qt4: new patch that modifies the
    QAssistantClient class to launch Qt Assistant as "assistant-qt4" to
    cope with the alternatives system (Closes: #327294)

  * debian/control: Upgraded libqt4-dev's dependencies on the modules
    libqt4-sql and libqt4-qt3support from suggests to depends, and added
    libpq-dev and libmysqlclient14-dev | libmysqlclient-dev as
    dependencies.  These dependencies are apparently required to make
    building pkg-config-using packages happy. (Closes: #327618)

  * debian/control: corrected libqt4-sql to suggest libmysqlclient14-dev,
    not libmysqlclient12-dev which is deprecated

  * debian/copyright: updated FSF snailmail address

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: removed the libqt3supportwidgets_debug.so
    designer plugin, since for some reason having this installed breaks
    designer (Closes: #325782)

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Install changes-4.0.1 as upstream changelog
  
  * debian/manpages/assistant-qt4.1: new manpage written from scratch
    based on the output of "assistant -help"

  * debian/manpages/designer-qt4.1, debian/manpages/linguist-qt4.1:
    manpages stolen from the Qt3 packages and trivially adapted for Qt4
    (Closes: #322403)

  * debian/manpages/moc-qt4.1: escape some '-' characters

  * debian/qt4-dev-tools.manpages: install the new assistant-qt4.1,
    designer-qt4.1, and linguist-qt4.1 manpages

  * debian/control: made qt4-dev-tools recommend qt4-doc, since assisant
    needs it to be useful (Closes: #323251)

  * Removed the FAQ from qt4-doc.docs, since it's no longer included in
    4.0.1, and was useless anyway

  * Build-depend on libmysqlclient14-dev since libmysqlclient12-dev is
    scheduled to be removed

  * debian/libqt4-dev.install: work around TT's broken "install" target in
    this release so that the pkgconfig files are installed in
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig instead of directly in /usr/lib.  Grrrr.

qt4-x11 (4.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed the xlibs-pic dependency to xlibs-static-pic
    for the X.org transition (Closes: #319586)

  * Added manpages for lrelease, lupdate, moc, qtconfig, and uic, stolen
    from the Qt3 upstream tarball, and wrote a manpage for qmake from
    scratch.  Since now manpages are included for all executables using
    the alternatives, the symlinks to them no longer dangle.
    (Closes: #319456)

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added
    usr/lib/qt4/plugins/imageformats/libqjpeg.so to include the jpeg
    plugin (Closes: #321582)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: added the libqjpeg_debug.so plugin
  
  * debian/rules: don't hardcode the /usr/include/postgresql/8.0 path,
    instead of the output of `pg_config --includedir`, stolen from Qt3
    packages

  * debian/libqt4-gui.install: added the OpenGL module library so that it
    actually gets included in a package (Closes: #321874)

  * debian/control: updated the package descriptions to note that the
    Network and XML modules are included in the libqt4-core package, and
    the OpenGL module is included in the libqt4-gui package

qt4-x11 (4.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * libqt4-dev: added /usr/bin/uic3 (Closes: #318451)

  * Transition to the new X.org packages:
    + (Build-)depend on libglu1-xorg-dev instead of xlibmesa-gl-dev
    + (Build-)depend on libxinerama-dev (Closes: #318682)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jul 2005 21:28:19 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
