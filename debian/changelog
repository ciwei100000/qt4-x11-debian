qt4-x11 (4.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - No longer includes "CONFIG = ... debug" in the mkspecs/qconfig.pri
      (Closes: #357136)
    - Fixes QFontDialog assert() failures (Closes: #380418)
    
  * debian/control: made libqt4-gui conflict/replace libqt4-designer, to
    ensure that old package is removed (Closes: #380253)

  * Enable Qt's new support for using the system's SQLite 3 library
    (Closes: #382238)

  * debian/rules: removed the PostgreSQL and MySQL include hacks from the
    configure arguments, since the configure script now autodetects them
    itself

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_for_debian.dpatch: updated for new upstream

  * debian/patches/13_arm_ftbfs_fixes.dpatch: updated for new upstream

  * debian/patches/19_s390_atomic.dpatch: removed, since it appears to be
    obsolete

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: changed the wildcards to match the new
    debug lib names.  What was once *_debug.so.* is now *.debug.  Ick.

  * debian/control: removed libqt4-debug-dev since now that the _debug
    libs have been removed and debugging symbols are shipped in their
    place, this package is no longer needed

  * Tar up the demos directory and include it in qt4-doc.  Also added the
    qtdemo binary to libqt4-dev. (Closes: #390925)

  * debian/rules: add -DQT_QLOCALE_USES_FCVT to the configure arguments
    when building on arm, like Qt3, to fix a uic problem (Closes: #386460)

  * debian/libqt4-gui.install: added usr/lib/libQtAssistantClient.so.*,
    since it's now shipped as a shared library; previously it was a static
    library

  * Added build-deps on libdbus-1-dev and libglib2.0-dev, and added
    libQtDBus to the libqt4-core package

qt4-x11 (4.1.4-1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Reintroduce the libpq-dev dependency, which seems to have been removed by
    mistake in 4.1.0-2. (Closes: #327618)

 -- Steinar H. Gunderson <sesse@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Aug 2006 01:10:59 +0200

qt4-x11 (4.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #378443)

  * Moved usr/lib/libQtDesigner.so.* and
    usr/lib/libQtDesignerComponents.so.* from qt4-designer to libqt4-gui
    so there the libqt4-dev package won't contain dangling symlinks
    (Closes: #374612)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Jul 2006 15:39:29 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/19_s390_atomic: patch from Bastian Blank to fix
    including of s390 specific atomic header. (Closes: #370241)

  * debian/patches/18_disable_opengl_visibility.dpatch: regenerated so
    that it applies correctly for me

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Jun 2006 11:42:57 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * patches/18_disable_opengl_visibility: disable -fvisibility-inlines-hidden
    for src/opengl/opengl.pro as it makes gcc ICE on alpha.
    (Closes: #368883)

  * urgency set to high so that qt4-x11 stops blocking half of unstable out of
    testing.

 -- Pierre Habouzit <madcoder@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jun 2006 10:28:29 +0200

qt4-x11 (4.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release

  * debian/patches/16_hppa_ldcw_fix.dpatch: new patch from Ubuntu to
    properly support hppa

  * debian/patches/17_alpha_ice.dpatch: new patch from Steve Langasek to
    fix FTBFS on alpha (Closes: #368883)
    (urgency set to high for that fix).

  * Dropped the .la files since they pull in too many unneeded
    dependencies (Closes: #360802)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: removed
    usr/lib/qt4/plugins/codecs/*_debug.so since those aren't included
    upstream anymore

  * Increased standards version to 3.7.2

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jun 2006 17:56:32 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libqt4-debug-dev.install, debian/libqt4-dev.install: added
    wildcards to install .a static libraries so that the libQtUiTools and
    libQtAssistantClient libraries are included (Closes: #358224, #355902)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sun, 14 May 2006 10:03:40 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * debian/control: removed dependencies on xlibs-static-dev and
    xlibs-static-pic to transition to building against modular X
    (Closes: #362262)

  * debian/control: changed x-dev dependencies to x11proto-core-dev, for
    modular X transition (Closes: #362053)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Apr 2006 10:35:28 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixes the broken debug-and-release build and a load of resulting
      bugs (Closes: #337764, #337847, #341807, #338380, #354993, #347251)
    - debian/patches/15_alpha_ftbfs_fix.dpatch: removed, integrated upstream

  * debian/control: updated libqt4-debug-dev priority to match that of the
    override file

  * debian/libqt4-dev.links: added a symlink /usr/share/qt4/bin/rcc to
    /usr/bin/rcc (Closes: #349438)

  * debian/libqt4-gui.install: added libqmng.so and libqgif.so plugins
    (Closes: #354266)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Mar 2006 10:20:47 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved *_debug.prl and *_debug.la support files to the libqt4-debug-dev
    package

  * Updated to debhelper v5 compatibility

  * debian/qt4-dev-tools.install: removed the /usr/share/qt4/templates
    entry, which no longer contains anything

  * Added gif support (Closes: #348092)

  * debian/patches/12_mips_atomic_ops.dpatch: applied fixes from Isaac
    Clerencia <isaac@debian.org>, as the last patch was not good enough to
    fix the FTBFS bug (Closes: #335831)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Jan 2006 09:49:11 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/12_mips_atomic_ops.dpatch: Updated patch to account for
    2 new functions, q_atomic_test_and_set_acquire_int and
    q_atomic_test_and_set_release_int, that were added in this release.
    This should again fix the build failures on mips. (Closes: #335831)

  * debian/patches/13_arm_ftbfs_fixes.dpatch: renamed, added a fix for the
    new build failure due to a poorly defined qreal (Closes: #347360)

  * debian/control: build against libmysqlclient15, and updated all
    dependencies to libmysqlclient15-dev (Closes: #346586)

  * debian/control: added explicit dependencies for libqt4-dev on the
    Source-Version packages libqt4-core, libqt4-gui, libqt4-sql, and
    libqt4-qt3support.  These dependencies were accidentally dropped in
    the last version.  Also removed some unneeded dependencies.

  * Split the *_debug.so symlinks out of libqt4-dev and into a separate
    libqt4-debug-dev package.  Made the libqt4-debug-dev package depend on
    the Source-Version of libqt4-debug.  This way, the symlinks won't be
    dangling if libqt4-debug isn't installed and prevents failed linking
    due to version mismatches.  (Closes: #346603, #346605)

  * Re-enabled sqlite3 support.  It's still statically linked, however,
    but that'll have to do because I really don't want to futz with the
    build system. (Closes: #330976)

  * Enabled sqlite2 support

  * debian/patches/15_alpha_ftbfs_fix.dpatch: new patch to rename
    q_atomic_test_and_set_release_ptr to q_atomic_test_and_set_ptr, as
    suggested by Isaac Clerencia <isaac@debian.org>, to fix a FTBFS on
    alpha. (Closes: #347353)

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_for_debian: renamed from
    10_qmake_use_qt4_tools, and updated to remove the "link_prl" from the
    default qmake CONFIG line.  This disables the recursive linkage
    against all indirectly-used libraries. (Closes: #343190)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Jan 2006 19:29:52 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Fixes missing QBitArray operators (Closes: #341658)
    - Fixes qmake problem with including bad build path (Closes: #327359)
  
  * Added the new QTestLib unit testing framework to the libqt4-core
    package

  * Added the new QtSvg module to the libqt4-gui package

  * debian/patches/13_arm_gcc4.dpatch: new patch from Jeremy Laine to fix
    FTBFS on arm (Closes: #343176)

  * debian/patches/14_kfreebsd_build_fix.dpatch: new patch from Petr
    Salinger to fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD (Closes: #343191)

  * Split the qtconfig tool out of libqt4-gui and into a separate
    qt4-qtconfig package, due to its linkage against libqt4-qt3support and
    hence ridiculous dependency chain.

  * debian/rules: improved/cleaned up the clean target

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Wed,  4 Jan 2006 12:56:23 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a target to automatically install lintian overrides, stolen from
    debian-qt-kde.mk

  * Added a bunch of lintian overrides for stuff that should be ignored

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Nov 2005 01:17:03 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: made libqt4-gui replace libqt4-core (<< 4.0.1-3), for
    the plugins move (Closes: #336492)

  * debian/control: removed the mention of a qt4-examples package that
    doesn't actually exist from the qt4-doc package description

  * debian/rules: remove all *.so files under
    examples/tools/plugandpaint/plugins/ in the clean target
    (Closes: #339674)

  * Removed the menu entry for designer-qt4 from qt4-dev-tools.menu, and
    added it to a new qt4-designer.menu

  * Added a tarball of the examples to qt4-doc (Closes: #336832)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Nov 2005 10:27:03 -0800

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed qt4-designer's section to "devel"

  * Added a patch from Thiemo Seufer to fix the FTBFS on mips/mipsel
    (Closes: #335831)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Oct 2005 00:13:40 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: only install the non-debug codecs, since
    the debug ones pull in a gratuitous dependency on libqt4-debug
    (Closes: #328913)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: install the debug codecs here instead

  * debian/control: replaced obsolete xlibs-dev dependency with the
    required split packages (Closes: #329302)

  * Completely disabled SQLite support since it's too fubar in this
    version to be usable.  The build fails with SQLite2 support, and
    SQLite3 is only supported by linking staticly with a version
    distributed in the Qt source.  Meh.

  * Renamed libqt4-designer to qt4-designer, merged in the designer binary
    from qt4-dev-tools, and added a dependency on libqt4-dev
    (Closes: #330094)

  * Moved the plugins installed in libqt4-core to libqt4-gui, since they
    link against the GUI library.  Otherwise a circular libqt4-core <->
    libqt4-gui dependency results.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Oct 2005 00:28:53 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/10_qmake_use_qt4_tools.dpatch: new patch that modifies
    qmake.conf so that qmake generates Makefiles that use the -qt4 tools.
    This way, it can cope with systems that have alternatives set to use
    the -qt3 versions.
  
  * Increased the conflicting Qt3 package versions to <= 3.3.4-7, since
    the Qt3 packages still don't use the alternatives system as needed to
    coexist with Qt4.
  
  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added /usr/lib/qt4/plugins/codecs

  * debian/patches/11_launch_assistant-qt4: new patch that modifies the
    QAssistantClient class to launch Qt Assistant as "assistant-qt4" to
    cope with the alternatives system (Closes: #327294)

  * debian/control: Upgraded libqt4-dev's dependencies on the modules
    libqt4-sql and libqt4-qt3support from suggests to depends, and added
    libpq-dev and libmysqlclient14-dev | libmysqlclient-dev as
    dependencies.  These dependencies are apparently required to make
    building pkg-config-using packages happy. (Closes: #327618)

  * debian/control: corrected libqt4-sql to suggest libmysqlclient14-dev,
    not libmysqlclient12-dev which is deprecated

  * debian/copyright: updated FSF snailmail address

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: removed the libqt3supportwidgets_debug.so
    designer plugin, since for some reason having this installed breaks
    designer (Closes: #325782)

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Sep 2005 12:32:53 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Install changes-4.0.1 as upstream changelog
  
  * debian/manpages/assistant-qt4.1: new manpage written from scratch
    based on the output of "assistant -help"

  * debian/manpages/designer-qt4.1, debian/manpages/linguist-qt4.1:
    manpages stolen from the Qt3 packages and trivially adapted for Qt4
    (Closes: #322403)

  * debian/manpages/moc-qt4.1: escape some '-' characters

  * debian/qt4-dev-tools.manpages: install the new assistant-qt4.1,
    designer-qt4.1, and linguist-qt4.1 manpages

  * debian/control: made qt4-dev-tools recommend qt4-doc, since assisant
    needs it to be useful (Closes: #323251)

  * Removed the FAQ from qt4-doc.docs, since it's no longer included in
    4.0.1, and was useless anyway

  * Build-depend on libmysqlclient14-dev since libmysqlclient12-dev is
    scheduled to be removed

  * debian/libqt4-dev.install: work around TT's broken "install" target in
    this release so that the pkgconfig files are installed in
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig instead of directly in /usr/lib.  Grrrr.

 -- Brian Nelson <pyro@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Aug 2005 19:28:35 -0700

qt4-x11 (4.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed the xlibs-pic dependency to xlibs-static-pic
    for the X.org transition (Closes: #319586)

  * Added manpages for lrelease, lupdate, moc, qtconfig, and uic, stolen
    from the Qt3 upstream tarball, and wrote a manpage for qmake from
    scratch.  Since now manpages are included for all executables using
    the alternatives, the symlinks to them no longer dangle.
    (Closes: #319456)

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added
    usr/lib/qt4/plugins/imageformats/libqjpeg.so to include the jpeg
    plugin (Closes: #321582)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: added the libqjpeg_debug.so plugin
  
  * debian/rules: don't hardcode the /usr/include/postgresql/8.0 path,
    instead of the output of `pg_config --includedir`, stolen from Qt3
    packages

  * debian/libqt4-gui.install: added the OpenGL module library so that it
    actually gets included in a package (Closes: #321874)

  * debian/control: updated the package descriptions to note that the
    Network and XML modules are included in the libqt4-core package, and
    the OpenGL module is included in the libqt4-gui package

    + (Build-)depend on libxinerama-dev (Closes: #318682)
