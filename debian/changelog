qt4-x11 (4.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: changed the xlibs-pic dependency to xlibs-static-pic
    for the X.org transition (Closes: #319586)

  * Added manpages for lrelease, lupdate, moc, qtconfig, and uic, stolen
    from the Qt3 upstream tarball, and wrote a manpage for qmake from
    scratch.  Since now manpages are included for all executables using
    the alternatives, the symlinks to them no longer dangle.
    (Closes: #319456)

  * debian/libqt4-core.install: added
    usr/lib/qt4/plugins/imageformats/libqjpeg.so to include the jpeg
    plugin (Closes: #321582)

  * debian/libqt4-debug.install: added the libqjpeg_debug.so plugin
  
  * debian/rules: don't hardcode the /usr/include/postgresql/8.0 path,
    instead of the output of `pg_config --includedir`, stolen from Qt3
    packages

  * debian/libqt4-gui.install: added the OpenGL module library so that it
    actually gets included in a package (Closes: #321874)

  * debian/control: updated the package descriptions to note that the
    Network and XML modules are included in the libqt4-core package, and
    the OpenGL module is included in the libqt4-gui package
