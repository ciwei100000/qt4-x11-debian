* Review and port remaining patches to Qt4.4.0
* Fix dpkg-shlibdeps failure: couldn't find library libQtWebKit.so.4
   debian/qt4-designer/usr/lib/qt4/plugins/designer/libqaxwidget.so (its RPATH is '').
* Find a way to enable exceptions only for XmlPatterns
  From Thiago:
  That would require some modification to the buildsystem, which hasn't
  happened so far. I don't think we have thought of that idea yet.
  Anyways, a simple workaround for your case is to build Qt without exceptions,
  then reconfigure with them and build QtXmlPatterns only. Unless the ABI for
  with/without exceptions changes for your compiler, of course.
* Check conflicts with WebKit and Phonon (from KDE4/kdelibs) packages
