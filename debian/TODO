* Review and port qt-copy patches to Qt4.4.0
* Find a way to enable exceptions only for XmlPatterns
  From Thiago:
  That would require some modification to the buildsystem, which hasn't
  happened so far. I don't think we have thought of that idea yet.
  Anyways, a simple workaround for your case is to build Qt without exceptions,
  then reconfigure with them and build QtXmlPatterns only. Unless the ABI for
  with/without exceptions changes for your compiler, of course.
* Phonon packages must be provided from KDE sources
* Webkit packages must be provided from WebKit.org
